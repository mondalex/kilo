# kilo
the kilo text editor
We are going to [build our own text editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) from scratch! The text editor is [antirez’s kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), with some changes. It’s about 1000 lines of C in a single file with no dependencies, and it implements all the basic features we expect in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.
